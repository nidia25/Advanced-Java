1. To deploy the current multithreaded  Spring application to the cloud I would use Microsoft Azure. This would be my preferred  cloud provider because it is a reliable environment with integrated Docker containers without managing underlying infrastructure.

2.To start I would set up an Azure Container store my Docker image.

3.Build my docker image locally with appropriate version tag and push it to my registry.

4. Create an Azure Container Instance with the image from step 3.

5.Lastly, I will deploy and expose my Azure Container instance to expose it on the internet or a private network--this will allow my app to be accessible to other users
